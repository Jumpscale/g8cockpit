## Getting Started

This example will guide you through all the steps required to deploy a blueprint using the Cockpit Portal. The goal of this exercise will be to create a new VDC on a G8 node.


### Creation of the AYS Repository
  
Before you can execute a blueprint you need to create an AYS repository. This repository will contain your blueprints and the service instances once the blueprint got executed.
  
To create a new repository click on the `AYS Repos` link in the menu:

This page displays all your repositories. On the right side of the page there is an drop-down menu. Chosse `Create AYS repository`. A popup form will appear. Choose the name of your repository and confirm your selection:

You can now see your new repository in the list of repos. Click on your newly created repository.


### Create the blueprint
 
Now that you have your repository ready, the next step is to create the blueprint for creating your virtual datacenter (VDC). Here is the blueprint we are going to use:  

```yaml
g8client__dubai:
  g8.url: 'du-conv-3.demo.greenitglobe.com'
  g8.login: 'demo1'
  g8.password: '*****'
  g8.account: 'demo1'

vdc__demo1:
  g8.client.name: ' dubai'
  maxMemoryCapacity: 2
  maxVDiskCapacity: 10
  maxCPUCapacity: 2
  maxNASCapacity: 20
  maxArchiveCapacity: 20
  maxNetworkOptTransfer: 5
  maxNetworkPeerTransfer: 15
  maxNumPublicIP: 1
```

To create this new blueprint click on the `explorer` link in the repository page. This will send you on the explorer page where you then navigate to your repository.

- Double click the blueprint folder
- Right click and select **new text file**
- Right click on the newly created file, select **edit file**
- An editor opens, paste the content of the blueprint, then save

### Execute the blueprint
 
Now that the blueprint is ready we need to execute it. This step will translate the blueprint in actual service instance. 

To do that:
- Go back to AYS Repos
- Select `execute blueprint` in the drop-down button
- In the popup that appears, leave the form empty and click confirm
- A message will tell you that your blueprint is executed

### Make sure the service instance are created

To be sure that the blueprint executed properly you can go back to AYS Repos and click the `instances` link under your new repository.
  
The instances page show you all the service instances in your repository. Click an instance will bring you to the **Instance Details** page.


### Simulate installation

Before installing the service, we want to simulate the installation and double check the service will behave as we want.  

From **AYS Repos** page click the simulator link. The simulator lets you preview what action will happen without actually executing them. Fill the form like shown in the next picture.

![simulator form](2016-06-17_846x396_scrot.png)

Here we want to simulate the `install` action and we don't want to filer on service role or instance. This means all services in the repository will be installed. Click the simulate button to have show the result of the simulation.

![simulation result](2016-06-17_566x259_scrot.png)

We see that the installation will be executed in two steps. First the `g8client` and `vdcfarm` service will be installed. then the `vdc`. These two steps are due to the fact that the `vdc` depend on the `g8client` and `vdcfarm`.


### Installing the services

Now that we are confident with the installation steps, we can actually do the installation.
To do that select the **install** option from the action drop-down button.

Like before, a popup form will appear. Select the same value as in the simulation and click confirm.

![](2016-06-17_579x357_scrot.png)

A message will tell you that the installation succeed.  

## Congratulations

You have just deployed a new VDC from your Cockpit Portal using AtYourService.

You can go have a look in the instance page to check the state of your services and see that the `install` method has now a state `OK`
