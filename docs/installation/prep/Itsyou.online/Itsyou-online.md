## Configure ItsYou.online

This is how a **Cockpit** depends on ItsYou.online:

- a **Cockpit** uses [ItsYou.online](http://www.itsyou.online) for authenticating users.
- a **Cockpit** is always deployed for a specific organization that needs to be registered at [ItsYou.online](http://www.itsyou.online).

Let's start by creating a new organization at [ItsYou.online](http://www.itsyou.online):

- Once logged in select **Organizations** from the dropdown menu that appears when clicking the pawn icon in the right top corner:

- Click the **+ CREATE NEW** in order to create a new organization:

- Here I create a new organization **cloud potatoes**:

As part of the [Cockpit installation process through Telegram](../Telegram/Telegram.md) you will be requested to authenticate on **ItsYou.online** and authorize the **Cockpit Chatbot** to verify that you are member/owner of the organization for which the **Cockpit** is setup.

Also later when using the **Cockpit Portal**, it will be verified that the user logging in to the **Cockpit Portal** is member of this organization.
