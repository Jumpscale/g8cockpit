## Installation of a Cockpit

A Cockpit can be installed in one of the two possible modes:

- [Development Mode](#development)
- [Production Mode](#production)

Both are discussed here below.

Once installed you will want to make sure that your Cockpit can push changes back to your Git server, as discussed [here below](#github)

### Installing a Cockpit in Development Mode

Installing a Cockpit in development mode can be achieved using **JumpScale Cuisine** as discussed in [Installing a Cockpit in Development Mode using JumpScale Cuisine](Using-Cuisine/using-cuisine.md).

Realize that for a Cockpit in development mode:

 - OAuth is by default disabled
 - Everything will be installed locally (all configurations will assume local)
 - You'll get the latest of the branch you're installing from, not the latest stable build, so proceed with caution
 - Part of the installation pulls in the most recent code, make sure the required code is committed first
 - Redis data is only kept in memory, not persisted to disk

While OAuth is disabled by default, you can manually enable OAuth integration, as discussed in [How to Configure ItsYou.online Integration](prep/Itsyou.online/configuration.md)

### Installing a Cockpit in Production Mode

There are two ways to install a new production Cockpit:

- [Installing using an AYS Blueprint](Using-Blueprint/using-blueprint.md)
- [Installing using Telegram](Using-Telegram/using-Telegram.md)

Both options require some pre-installation preparation, documented [here](prep/prep.md).

### Allow the Cockpit to push to your Github repository

The last thing you need to do is enabling your **Cockpit** to save all AYS services information into your GitHub repository.

This is achieved by adding the deploy key generated by the **Cockpit** to the deploy keys of your GitHub repository:

- Go to the **Settings** page of the GitHub repository specified during installation
- Click **Add deploy key** in the **Deploy keys** tab
- Copy the content of the public key that you can find in the **Information** page of your **Cockpit Portal**:

- Select **Allow write access** and click the **Add key** button
